# Weather App

In this project you will be building a functional weather app. You will use an API to get real weather data to display.

You will use this [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/wPElVpR1rwA) as a guide.

This project consists of both frontend and backend work. For the frontend you will need to make the layout and design of the weather app in HTML and CSS. To start, you can write HTML a single state of the weather app. For example you can type 55 for the temperature. Later, when you get to the backend portion you can replace this static text with the value you get from the API.

## Notes

- Instead of the Darksky API you will use weatherapi.com. You can use the API URL listed below to get weather data.
- You will use the designs provided in this project instead of the ones in the Youtube video.

## Variables

- API URL: `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=5863755acb594078956213139202910&q=Boston`
